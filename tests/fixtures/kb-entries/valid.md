id: windows-atomic-rename-not-truly-atomic
problem: >
  Node's fs.rename on Windows is not strictly atomic when the destination
  exists, because MoveFileEx is a multi-step operation under the hood.
symptoms:
  - "EBUSY on rename"
  - "Target file briefly missing after a crash"
solution: >
  Write to a same-directory tmp file, fsync, rename, and on the next read
  sweep for orphaned tmp siblings. Promote the tmp file if the target is
  missing; delete it if the target is present and current.
