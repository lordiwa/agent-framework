// src/agent-generator.js
// TASK-013 — emit `.claude/agents/project-context.md` from PROJECT.md (or from
// an injected `answers` map) so every subagent reads the same stack-aware
// briefing before starting work.
//
// The single-file design is locked by the ticket: four base agents
// (developer/reviewer/researcher/orchestrator) capture role, and this one
// generated file captures stack + project type. A future contributor adds a
// new project_type by appending one entry to `TYPE_SPECIFIC_GUIDANCE` below —
// the per-type body lives in this module rather than fanning out across N
// templated files so the surface stays one literal long.
//
// File layout (mirrors what tests/agent-generator.spec.js asserts):
//   ---
//   project_name: ...
//   project_type: ...
//   generated_at: ...
//   schema_version: 1
//   ---
//
//   ## Stack
//   - key: value
//   - ...
//
//   ## Testing conventions
//   <prose>
//
//   ## Linting and formatting
//   <prose>
//
//   ## Type-specific guidance
//   - <bullet>
